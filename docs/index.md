# ECE5 Final Project: A Line Following Robot 

---

## The Robot: Team 4 Bird Squad's TurtleBot
**Introduction:**
   The Birb Team decided to create a TurtleBot, a common robot used in educational robotics. The team ultimately decided that a TurtleBot best represented the spirit of ECE5, a course that has allowed us to learn, explore but most importantly create. 
   ECE5 has been instrumental in the creation of our TurtleBot, every topic covered played a role in completing our project, C programming, microcontrollers, Onshape for 3D modeling, and 3D printing. The skills we have learned within ECE5 have given us a solid foundation in designing, prototyping, embeded systems and website deign which will allow us to excel in future projects.
