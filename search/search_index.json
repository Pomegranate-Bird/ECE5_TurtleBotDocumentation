The initial design was inspired from an existing robot but it had to be modified to fullfill the constraints of ECE 5's final project. Which meant making the design work with only the supplies provided. Iterations: With exploration iterations await, failed designs that had fatal flaws had became steps towards our final design.In the end the problems we faced furthered our understanding of fabrication and design. Some of the problems faced that we overcame with our itertains 1. Un-even mass distribution. Our center of mass was in an un-desired position causing the robot to follow a circular trajectory instead of a linear one. 2. Motor placements: The location of the motors is crucial for ensuring that the weight is distributed evenly, preventing the robot from overworking the motors. 3. 3D Printing: One of the issues faced during the creation of the project was wait time, having to wait until a 3D printer was free from use. An additional problem faced was failed prints, not using supports when overhangs are present. Certain printers have time printing upright which caused a problem when printing our TurtleBot's pillars. 3D Modeling Iterations 3D Model Iterations: Final Model Robot Iterations Final Robot Learning Lesson: Failure in nature is an opportunity to grow a deeper understanding of a problem.","title":"Prototyping"},{"location":"advice/#project-advice","text":"","title":"Project Advice"},{"location":"advice/#prototyping-testing","text":"The Creation Process: TurtleBot Our TurtleBot was created from the results of many design, and previous prototypes.

They originate from a field called control theory, which focuses on creating mathematical models of systems. By developing a mathematical model, engineers can design control functions that produce desired outcomes and ensure the system behaves in a stable and predictable way. Differential Drive Model: Our TurtleBot is an example of a control system. The kinematics of the TurtleBot can be described by the differential drive model. Unlike a car, which uses a steering joint to turn its front wheels, our TurtleBot turns by varying the speeds of its two wheels. By increasing the speed of one wheel and decreasing the speed of the other, the robot can rotate left or right. Proportional Intergral Derivitave Controller: Explaining each term of the controller: P: Proprotional term of the controller measures the current error of the system. The proprotional term of the controller calculates how off the robot is from the black line. That error is then mutliplied by a gain which is used to steer the robot back onto the black line. I: Integral term of the controller occumulates past-errors over time. The Integral portion of the controller is useful in reducing steady state error. It allows the robot to stay some threshold within the objective. By measuing that the accumulation of previous errors is decreaing it allows the robot to stay within proximity of the line even if it's not exactly spot on. D: Derivitave term of the controller measures the rate of change of the system. The Derivitave portion of the controller is useful in reducing oscilations. By measuring the rate at which the error is changing the derivitave portion of the controller reduces how much the robot overshoots the line. K Terms: All of the K terms are constant-terms decided by the user, they're not random, they're discoevered by trial and error in a process called tunning. The K terms decide how aggressively the PID components will contribute to the outcome. We tune these values using the potentiometer onboard the robot. Sp: The nomial speed of the robot, the base the speed will move without the PID's influence. Competition PID Values: Theory In Action Track 1: Sp: 65 P: 50 I: 0 D: 0 The track was relatively simple, it didn't have big turns or strange geometry. Allowing us to focus simply on speed Track 2: The Loop track was simple enough that we didn't have to modify our PID values to drastically. The geometry was also realtively simple. Sp:55 P:50 I: D: Track 3: The frequncy track's geometry was rather complex, full of turns and sharp corners. To avoid overshooting and having a spiriling error, we decided that a lower speed would be best. The lower speed allowed us to complete a good portion of the track. Given more time, could've better tuned for the frequency track.

By utilizing the fact that darker colors absorb more light than lighter colors, we can use photoresistors to measure how much light is reflected off a line. When light bounces back from the surface, our photoresistors detect this reflected light and produce a voltage that can be read by our ESP32. Since our microcontroller cannot measure resistance directly, it's not a multimeter, we use voltage measurements instead to detect the line. A major engineering problem when designing our robot that relies on light sensing is noise, particularly ambient light, which can interfere with the data the sensors collect. To address this, we decided to create a TurtleBot with a small skirt around the sensors to block most ambient light. Additionally, to reduce the impact of random noise, we generate our own controlled light source rather than relying solely on the room\u2019s variable lighting conditions. Another important system component that ensures successful line following is a PID controller, which stabilizes the robot\u2019s trajectory and allows it to respond smoothly to deviations from the line and potential disturbances. 3D Modeling Construction To complete our objective of following a line, we had to assemble the components that would allow our robot to move, detect a line, and allow for quick PID tuning.
