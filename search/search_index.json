They originate from a field called control theory, which focuses on creating mathematical models of systems. By developing a mathematical model, engineers can design control functions that produce desired outcomes and ensure the system behaves in a stable and predictable way. Example: Our TurtleBot is an example of a system. The kinematics of the TurtleBot can be described by the differential drive model. Unlike a car, which uses a steering joint to turn its front wheels, our TurtleBot turns by varying the speeds of its two wheels. By increasing the speed of one wheel and decreasing the speed of the other, the robot can rotate left or right. The Differential Drive Model Proportional Intergral Derivitave Controller: Explaining each term of the controller: P: Proprotional term of the controller measures the current error of the system. The proprotional term of the controller calculates how off the robot is from the black line. That error is then mutliplied by a gain which is used to steer the robot back onto the black line. I: Integral term of the controller occumulates past-errors over time. The Integral portion of the controller is useful in reducing steady state error. It allows the robot to stay some threshold within the objective. By measuing that the accumulation of previous errors is decreaing it allows the robot to stay within proximity of the line even if it's not exactly spot on. D: Derivitave term of the controller measures the rate of change of the system. The Derivitave portion of the controller is useful in reducing oscilations. By measuring the rate at which the error is changing the derivitave portion of the controller reduces how much the robot overshoots the line. K Terms: All of the K terms are constant-terms decided by the user, they're not random, they're discoevered by trial and error in a process called tunning. The K terms decide how aggressively the PID components will contribute to the outcome.","title":"Proportional Integral Derivitave Controller"},{"location":"pid/#controlling-a-turtlebot","text":"","title":"Controlling a TurtleBot"},{"location":"pid/#pid-controllers","text":"Background on Control Theory PID controllers, otherwise known as Proportional\u2013Integral\u2013Derivative controllers, are tools used to regulate the behavior of a system.

By utilizing the fact that darker colors absorb more light than lighter colors, we can use photoresistors to measure how much light is reflected off a line. When light bounces back from the surface, our photoresistors detect this reflected light and produce a voltage that can be read by our ESP32. Since our microcontroller cannot measure resistance directly, it's not a multimeter, we use voltage measurements instead to detect the line. A major engineering problem when designing our robot that relies on light sensing is noise, particularly ambient light, which can interfere with the data the sensors collect. To address this, we decided to create a TurtleBot with a small skirt around the sensors to block most ambient light. Additionally, to reduce the impact of random noise, we generate our own controlled light source rather than relying solely on the room\u2019s variable lighting conditions. Another important system component that ensures successful line following is a PID controller, which stabilizes the robot\u2019s trajectory and allows it to respond smoothly to deviations from the line and potential disturbances. 3D Modeling Picture of the assembly of the parts in OnShape Have a link to the OnShape file Construction A picture of all the parts printed The list of components we had to assemble Basically detail how we built the Robot Final product Picture of the robot assembled","title":"Robot"},{"location":"robot/#ece-5-line-following-turtlebot","text":"","title":"ECE 5 Line Following TurtleBot"},{"location":"robot/#objective-follow-a-line-autonomously","text":"How can we follow a line without having ambient light get in the way?
